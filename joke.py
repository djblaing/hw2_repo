        I found and copied a transcription someone posted on reddit :)
        
        A moth goes into a podiatrist’s office, and the podiatrist says, “What seems to be the problem, moth?”
        
        The moth says “What’s the problem? Where do I begin, man? I go to work for Gregory Illinivich,
        and all day long I work. Honestly doc, I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore. I don’t even know
        if Gregory Illinivich knows. He only knows that he has power over me, and that seems to bring him
        happiness. But I don’t know, I wake up in a malaise, and I walk here and there… at night I…
        sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that’s on my arm. A lady that I once loved,
        doc. I don’t know where to turn to. My youngest, Alexendria, she fell in the… in the cold of last
        year. The cold took her down, as it did many of us. And my other boy, and this is the hardest pill
        to swallow, doc. My other boy, Gregarro Ivinalititavitch… I no longer love him. As much as it pains
        me to say, when I look in his eyes, all I see is the same cowardice that I… that I catch when I take
        a glimpse of my own face in the mirror. If only I wasn’t such a coward, then perhaps… perhaps I
        could bring myself to… Doc, sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I’m a moth, just barely
        hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I’m not feeling good.
        
        And so the doctor says, “Moth, man, you’re troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist.
        Why on earth did you come here?”
